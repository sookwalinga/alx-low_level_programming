Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors (or "bugs") in software programs. When a program doesn't behave as expected or throws an error, debugging is necessary to identify and correct the problem.

Some methods of debugging manually include:

Print statements: adding print statements to the code to display the values of certain variables at different points in the program, helping you track the execution of the program and identify the source of the error.

Code inspection: manually reading through the code to check for syntax errors, missing brackets or semicolons, or any other mistakes that may cause the program to fail.

Code isolation: identifying specific portions of the code that may be causing errors and testing them separately from the rest of the program.

Using a debugger: stepping through the program line by line and examining the values of variables to identify where the program is not behaving as expected.

To read the error messages in C, you need to understand what each message means. Some common error messages include "undeclared identifier", which means that a variable or function is being used before it is declared, and "undefined reference", which means that the linker cannot find the definition for a function that is being called. The error message will often include a line number or a file name to help you identify where the error is occurring. You can then use one of the manual debugging methods to track down and fix the error.
